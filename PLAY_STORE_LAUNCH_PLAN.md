## Current Status: Ready for Configuration

Your app is **feature-complete** and well-architected. This document outlines the steps to launch on Google Play Store.

---

## Pre-Launch Checklist

### Phase 1: Account Setup (Required First)

#### 1.1 Create Expo Account (if not already done)
- [ ] Go to https://expo.dev/signup
- [ ] Create an account and verify email
- [ ] Note your **username** (you'll need it for app.json)

#### 1.2 Create Expo Project
```bash
cd frontend
npx expo login  # Login to your Expo account
npx expo whoami # Verify you're logged in
eas init        # This will create a projectId automatically
```

#### 1.3 Create Google Play Developer Account
- [ ] Go to https://play.google.com/console
- [ ] Pay the one-time $25 registration fee
- [ ] Complete identity verification (may take 24-48 hours)

---

### Phase 2: Configuration Updates

#### 2.1 Update app.json
After running `eas init`, your `app.json` should be updated automatically. Verify these values:

```json
{
  "expo": {
    "extra": {
      "eas": {
        "projectId": "<your-actual-project-id>"  // Auto-generated by eas init
      }
    },
    "owner": "<your-expo-username>"  // Your Expo account username
  }
}
```

#### 2.2 Version Strategy
- Current version: `1.0.0` (versionCode: 1)
- For each Play Store update, increment `versionCode`
- For significant updates, increment `version` string

---

### Phase 3: Backend Deployment

#### 3.1 Deploy MongoDB Database
**Option A: MongoDB Atlas (Recommended - Free tier available)**
- [ ] Create account at https://www.mongodb.com/atlas
- [ ] Create a free M0 cluster
- [ ] Create database user and note credentials
- [ ] Whitelist IP addresses or allow access from anywhere (0.0.0.0/0)
- [ ] Get connection string: `mongodb+srv://<user>:<password>@cluster.xxxxx.mongodb.net/family_finance`

**Option B: Self-hosted**
- Deploy MongoDB on your own server

#### 3.2 Deploy FastAPI Backend
**Recommended Platforms:**
| Platform | Free Tier | Pros |
|----------|-----------|------|
| Railway | 500 hours/month | Easy setup, auto-deploy |
| Render | 750 hours/month | Good for FastAPI |
| Fly.io | 3 shared VMs | Great performance |
| DigitalOcean | $5/month | Reliable, scalable |

**Deployment Steps (Example: Railway):**
```bash
cd backend

# Install Railway CLI
npm install -g @railway/cli

# Login and deploy
railway login
railway init
railway add
railway variables add MONGO_URL="mongodb+srv://..."
railway variables add DB_NAME="family_finance"
railway variables add SECRET_KEY="your-secure-random-key-here"
railway variables add CORS_ALLOW_ORIGINS="*"
railway up
```

**Note your production API URL:** `https://your-app.railway.app`

#### 3.3 Configure Frontend Environment
Set the backend URL for production builds:

```bash
# In Expo/EAS, set this as a secret
eas secret:create --name EXPO_PUBLIC_BACKEND_URL --value "https://your-backend-url.com"
```

Or update `frontend/.env` (not recommended for production secrets).
