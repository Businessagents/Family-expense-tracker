## Post-Processing & Enhancement

### Image Editing Tools

**Recommended Tools:**

4. **Screenshot.rocks** - Online tool for adding device frames

### Enhancement Steps

#### 1. Crop & Resize (if needed)
- Target: 1080 x 2340 px (or your captured resolution)
- Remove status bar if it contains time/battery (optional)
- Keep consistent across all screenshots

#### 2. Add Device Frame (Optional but Recommended)

**Using Figma:**
1. Import screenshot
2. Add device mockup (search "Android phone mockup")
3. Place screenshot inside mockup
4. Export as PNG

**Pre-made Mockups:**
- mockuphone.com
- smartmockups.com

#### 3. Add Text Overlay (Optional)

**Best Practices:**

**Example Overlays:**
```

```
